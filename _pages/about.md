Hi, my name is Weize Chen (ÈôàÁ∫¨Ê≥Ω(Áé∞)/ÈôàÊöêÊ≥Ω(Êóß)), and I am currently a 4th-year PhD student at Tsinghua University, advised by [Prof. Zhiyuan Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/). I am also a proud member of the [THUNLP](https://github.com/THUNLP/) group. I earned my bachelor‚Äôs degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University.

My research focuses on **natural language processing (NLP)** and **machine learning (ML)**, with a particular emphasis on improving the performance and efficiency of **agent systems** and **large language model (LLM)** systems.

Specifically, my research interests lie in:

- **(Multi-)Agent Systems**: Designing and implementing agent systems for LLMs and MLLMs to enhance performance. My work also explores improving agent communication and cooperation for more effective collaboration.
- **Inference Scaling Laws**: Investigating methods to scale inference-time compute for better performance on complex reasoning tasks efficiently.

Before ChatGPT, my research interests included **neural ODE/SDE**, **hyperbolic neural networks**, and **knowledge graphs**. These experiences continue to inform my perspective on advancing AI.

# News

- **[2024-10]** üöÄ **[Optima](https://chenweize1998.github.io/optima-project-page/)** (*Optimizing the effectiveness and efficiency of multi-agent systems*) is now released! Our paper demonstrates that iterative training for multi-agent systems significantly enhances performance and efficiency, achieving up to **90% reduction in inference tokens** while delivering superior performance. Moreover, with fewer inference tokens, **we establish a better inference scaling law**!

- **[2024-07]** üöÄ **[IoA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07061)** (*Internet of Agents*) has been released! We introduce the concept of connecting heterogeneous and distributed agents via the Internet and present a [prototype implementation](https://github.com/OpenBMB/IoA) functioning as an instant-messaging app for agents. Our experiments on complex agent tasks, embodied agents, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) demonstrate the effectiveness of IoA.

- **[2024-01]** üéâ **[AgentVerse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10848)** has been accepted to **ICLR 2024**! See you in Vienna! Also take a try at our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/OpenBMB/AgentVerse), which now has **more than 4k stars**!
